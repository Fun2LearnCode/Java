# Lab 9

Lab 9 is about control structures in java. There are three main categories for control structures and there will be an assignment on each. Each assignment uses user input, the code for each scanner will be in the example class files. This example code does not have to be used, but scanners are not the focus of the assignment.

## Loops

The tasks for loops is to create a list of the multiples of specific numbers under a set value, both of which a user will input. An example of this is all the multiplies of 2 under 9, the program would output 2, 4, 6, and 8. This is to be done 3 times, using each loop, once.

## if, else if, and else

The task for if statements is to create a program that takes in a numerical grade from console, 0-100, and prints out the letter grade that matches. A table of the grade ranges can be found below:

| Grade Range    | Letter Grade   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| 90-100         | A              |
| 80-89          | B              |
| 70-79          | C              |
| 50-69          | D              |
| 0-49           | F              |


## Switches

The task for switches in java is to create a program that takes in a day of the week from a user using console input and outputs a line of text about the day. An example for text output would be "Monday is the first day of the week".
