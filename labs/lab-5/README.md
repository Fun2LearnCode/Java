# Lab 5

Lab 5 is meant to be an easy but repetitive lab. The goal of this lab is to understand what each method type and the terminology used.

There are examples of each method and the class variable in the example folder.

In order to understand each, and know how to write each of these a class with a class variable of each datatype, with getter and setter methods, will be made.
