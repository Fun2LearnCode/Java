# Lab 19

Lab 19 is about Exceptions.

## Exceptions

Exceptions in Java are ways to encounter an error and keep running without breaking. These are errors that might be encountered, like trying to load a missing file. We wouldn't want to crash an entire application because one file is missing.

The lab is to read 314 - 318 in the book.
