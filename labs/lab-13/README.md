# Lab 13

Lab 13 is about array sorts.

## Sorts

We cover the sorts in class, and they will not be explained here. Wikipedia has visualizations of each sort if needed.

The goal of the lab is to improve on the BubbleSort (provided in examples) and make it a smart bubble sort. After this an insertion, and selection sort should both be programmed. They can all be in the same file, under different methods.
