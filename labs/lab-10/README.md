# Lab 10

Lab 10 is about ternary operators and the methods of strings.

## Ternary operators

Ternary operators can be use in place of if then statements, however when an else if is introduced its best not to use them. Because of this they are used in very simple situations, so the lab is also simple.

The lab is to take in a number, make it positive and print it out. An if statement could do this, but use a ternary operator.

## String methods.

All the string methods that we will be using are found on page 106-110 of the book. Using these methods there are a set of questions that need to be answered about the string provided in the example lab. The string is a copy and pasting from wikipedia's article about pizza, and it's very long, so it's best to use the methods of a string.

The questions are as follows:

    1. The length of the string.
    2. The index of the first appearance of the letter z.
    3. The 2017'th character.
    4. The phrase found between the characters 340 and 362.
    5. Does the phrase found between the characters 861 and 980 start with, or end with the word pizza.
    6. Does the string contain the word pie, if yes, where?
    7. Not a question but, change all the mentions of pizza to a different food.

The program should be able to run once and display all of these questions, this means for question 6 having an if statement to check where if it does exist.

#### Additional work (if needed)

In the prior lab, for switch cases, some students check multiple capitalizations of the words, resulting in more than 8 cases, if this is the case, use what you now know about string methods to fix this so that no matter the capitalization the switch will output the correct fact.
