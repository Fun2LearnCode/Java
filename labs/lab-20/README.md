Lab 20 is about begins the review.

## Review

This lab will be a review of lab 5. Lab 5 covered instance fields, and methods. The lab will be to create a class called person. Person needs to have a name, an age, a hair color and if they have a pet. You will need getters for each of these, but setters only when needed. Let's assume people cannot change their name, and their age can only go up by one.
