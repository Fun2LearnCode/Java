# Lab 3

For Lab3 you'll be creating a calculator. This calculator can only do a few things and they are all laid out in the example Calculator class found in the example folder.

The calculator should be able to take input from the console, then the operator, and then the other number.

Example input:

3

``+``

4

Example output:

7

## Extra tasks

A few optional tasks are provided if the project is too simple. While doing the extra tasks feel free to add methods and class variables as needed.

### Task one

Accepting more than two numbers and one operator

Example input:

3

``+``

4

//console output of 7

``+``

5

// console output of 12

### Task two

Accepting all arguments on one line. This is separate from adding more than one operator and is not meant to work with multiple operators.

This task is very easy if you understand how scanners work.

Example input:

3 + 4

Example output:

7

### Task Three

adding a toBinary method to the calculator that returns the binary string. Some way is needed to denote that you want it to be in binary, to do this I'm using the character b as a operator.

Example input:

7

b

Example output:

111
