# Lab 12

Lab 12 is about arrays.

## Arrays

Arrays are lists of datatypes (primitive or not) that are defined by the data they store and the place on the array where they are stored. Each item has no idea what comes before, or after it and is completely independent of all the other list items. Likewise an array is immutable and is a reference type that only stores a memory address.

### Part 1

Create an array that contains the numbers 0 to 1000000.

### Part 2

Create an array of randomly generated numbers ranging from 0 to 2000. The array needs to be 1000 elements long as to prevent any hard coding.

This part will require the use of Math.random() a method that creates a double between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
