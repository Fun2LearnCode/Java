# Lab 7

Lab 7 is a lab about variable scopes and default values for variables of different scopes. A scope is the location in the code where the variable is able to be accessed. There are two main variable scopes, local variables' scopes and instance variables' scope. Because this lab is more about understanding how they differ
the main portion of this lab will just be trying several examples and finding out what happens to each value. A list of cases is provided below.

  * Find the default value (declared but not initialized) of instance variables, if any.
  * Find the default value (declared but not initialized) of local variables (those found within a method), if any.
  * Find where variables declared and initialized inside a loop can be used.
  * Find where variables declared and initialized inside a method can be used.
  * Find where variables declared and initialized inside an if statement can be used.

  While all of these are found in the book, it's best to try and figure them out for yourself, check compare your findings with those on page 29-34
