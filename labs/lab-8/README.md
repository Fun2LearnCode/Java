# Lab 8

Lab 8 is about bitwise and short circuit operators. The primary difference between the two is that the bitwise operators returns a number, and short circuit returns a boolean. Bitwise operators and short circuit operators are shown below in a table.

| Symbol         | Effect         | type           |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| &              | AND            | Bitwise        |
| &#124;         | OR             | Bitwise        |
| ^              | XOR            | Bitwise        |
| &&             | AND            | Short circuit  |
| &#124;&#124;   | OR             | Short circuit  |
| !              | NOT            | Short circuit  |

The goal of the lab is to understand the differences between these two sets of `AND` and `OR` statements, and to be able to answer a few questions about each. The questions are below:

### Questions

1. Do bitwise operators work in if statements? Why or why not?

2. Do short circuit operators work in if statements? Why or why not?

3. Do parenthesis matter in either operation?

4. How could you use bitwise operators in an if statement?

5. What does not do?

6. When can not be used? (What data type can it be used on?)
