# Lab 11

Lab 11 is about the methods of stringbuilders.

## StringBuilder methods.

All the stringbuilder's methods that we will be using are found on page 114-116 of the book. Using these methods there are a set of questions that need to be answered about the string provided in the example lab. The string is a copy and pasting from wikipedia's article about pizza, and it's very long, so it's best to use the methods of a string.

The questions are as follows:

    1. The length of the string.
    2. The index of the first appearance of the letter z.
    3. The 2017'th character.
    4. The phrase found between the characters 340 and 362.
    5. Does the phrase found between the characters 861 and 980 start with, or end with the word pizza.
    6. Does the string contain the word pie, if yes, where?
    7. Not a question but, change all the mentions of pizza to a different food.
    8. Create a new stringbuilder and append something to it.

The program should be able to run once and display all of these questions, this means for question 6 having an if statement to check where if it does exist.
